## The Writing Quests Trackers

### Gertrude's googlesheet tracker
[There is a view-only google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zsjBv1wG4HquO-azqirvdHXDLQRak067?usp=sharing:) with the [Writing Quests Progress Tracker](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qUSBlYEVbFf8jbrorG7CvaaDJ_3oz8uu) (based on google sheets). It features some fun Easter Eggs for users to discover and can track different types of writing projects.

### Questy web tracker
We are also developing a web-based next-generation tracker called [Questy](https://questy.writingquests.org) ([questy.writingqusts.org](https://questy.writingquests.org)). It is open for beta testing; it is fairly basic but [we have plans for improving it](https://github.com/Writing-Quests/quest-tracker/wiki).
